    <p>Who is Denise Ballard?
    	<br>
	I was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I love all the Philadelphia sports teams winning or losing.
	I went to a private catholic schools which explains any of my personality issues and my understanding of 
	the importance of education. 
	I went to Temple University where I played volleyball, which I continued playing on a regular basis. 
    </p>
 <p> 
After trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up I joined the United States Air Force. I became 
a Medical Laboratory Technician. I was stationed in Ankara Turkey and was able to vacation in Greece. 
Once I came back to the states I was stationed in Biloxi Missippi where I meant my husband. We were stationed 
in Virgina at Langley Air Force Base, Tactical Headquarters where I had both my sons.

 I completed my degree in 2 areas, Medical Technology and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.We were 
 still coding in COBOL and FORTRAN which were manadatory  to have a minor in Computer Science.
</p>
<p>
	Fast forward and you find me and my family living in Atlanta Georgia. I worked as a Medical Technologist until there 
	was an opening in IT department to begin introducing computers to the laboratory. I then made the transition officially 
	to the IT world and kept the passion of a Med Tech.
	Working for the Departement of Treasury on the automated payment system as a Test lead has allowed me to 
	use all of my skills 
	accumulated over the years. This includes the soft skills of getting other people to do what I want for them to do.
</p>
<p>
	The final question is who will Denise Ballard be upon completion of the KU Coding Bootcamp? Please stay tuned.
