<h1>Denise Ballard</h1>
<p>Who is Denise Ballard?
	I am originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I was born and raised there. I love all the Philadelphia teams winning or losing. I went to a private catholic schools which explains any of my personality issues and my understanding of the importance of education. I went to Temple University where I played volleyball. After trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up I joined the United States Air Force. I became a Medical Laboratory Technician. I was stationed in Ankara Turkey and vacationed in Greece. Once I came back to the states I was stationed in Biloxi Missippi where I meant my husband. We were stationed in Virgina at Langley Air Force Base, Tactical Headquarters. I had both my sons in Virginia. I completed my degree in 2 areas, Medical Technology and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.
	We where still coding in COBOL at that time and FORTRAN was a manadatory requirement to have a minor in Computer Science.
	Fast forward and you find me and my family living in Atlanta Georgia. I worked as a Medical Technologist until there was an opening in IT department to begin introducing computers to the laboratory. I then made the transition officially to the IT world and kept the passion of a Med Tech.
	Working for the Departement of Treasury on the automated payment system as a Test lead has allowed me to use all of my skills accumulated over the years. This includes the soft skills of getting other people to do what I want for them to do.
	The final question is who will Denise Ballard be upon completion of the KU Coding Bootcamp? Please stay tuned.
